# PLP Final Project

One of United Nation&#39;s Sustainable Development Goals is [Zero Hunger(Goal 2)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/  "Zero Hunger(Goal 2)") . In retrospect, one of Kenya&#39;s [Big 4 Agenda](https://monitoring.planning.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Big-Four-Agenda-Report-2018_19.pdf "Big 4 Agenda") has been Food Security. The nexus of these two therefore is food availability. As of July 2022, agriculture sector accounts for 20% of Kenya&#39;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs over 40% of the total population with more than 70% being of rural populace, this is according to a [survey](https://www.centralbank.go.ke/2022/07/29/mpc-agriculture-survey-july-2022/#:~:text=The%20agriculture%20sector%20continues%20to,percent%20of%20the%20rural%20populace. "survey") done by the Central Bank of Kenya&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee. In light of this, farmers and the entire food supply chain play a huge role in Kenya&#39;s development, however, farmers profit little from this.

## Problem Statement
Middlemen such as commission agents, traders and wholesalers take a major chunk of profit from farmers produce. This leaves very little for the farmers. [More on this](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/the-standard/article/2001256300/farmers-warned-against-middlemen "More on this").

## Prototype
The project is set up as an e-commerce app. The Homepage displays merchant information, and top picks, the Shop page displays various products offered by different merchants, and the Map page displays cities from which merchants are located.

## Overall Architecture
The project is divided into backend and frontend. The backend is written in Python using Django Framework and frontend in Dart using Flutter Framework.
Python was chosen due to its versatility in the Machine Learning industry this therefore makes it easier to extend such functionalities to the backend in the future.
Flutter was chosen due to its multi-platform capabilities and the vast out-of-the-box Widgets readily available.

## Start
The server needs to be running first hence set up the [backend first](https://github.com/eddieogola/plp/tree/master/backend#backend).
Once the server is running. The frontend is now ready to consume the backend API. Set up the [frontend](https://github.com/eddieogola/plp/tree/master/frontend#frontend)
Now start the app.
